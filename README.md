# Gray scale heat map representation
This project is a greyscale heat map of the [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/), is designed to start thinking in the visual hierarchy of the different elements in a webpage. Also, the structure and methodology of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css/lessons/design-teardown) were implemented along with many of the UX UI design techniques.
